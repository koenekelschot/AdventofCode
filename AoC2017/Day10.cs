            //(the first element in the list), a skip size (which starts at 0), and a sequence of 
            //lengths (your puzzle input). Then, for each length:
            // - Reverse the order of that length of elements in the list, starting with the element 
            //   at the current position.
            // - Move the current position forward by that length plus the skip size.
            // - Increase the skip size by one.
            //The list is circular; if the current position and the length try to reverse elements 
            //beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses using as many extra elements as it 
            //needs from the front of the list.If the current position moves past the end of the list, 
            //it wraps around to the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.
            //Here's an example using a smaller list:
            //Suppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
            //were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.
            // - The list begins as [0] 1 2 3 4 (where square brackets indicate the current position).
            // - The first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to 
            //   be reversed).
            // - After reversing that section (0 1 2 into 2 1 0), we get ([2] 1 0) 3 4.
            // - Then, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 
            //   2 1 0[3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.
            // - The second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.
            // - The sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3: 4 3) 0 ([1] 2.
            // - The current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, 
            //   causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2. The skip size increases to 2.
            // - The third length, 1, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.
            // - The current position moves forward by the length (1) plus the skip size (2): 4 [3] 0 1 2.
            //   The skip size increases to 3.
            // - The fourth length, 5, selects every element starting with the second: 4) ([3] 0 1 2. Reversing 
            //   this sublist (3 0 1 2 4 into 4 2 1 0 3) produces: 3) ([4] 2 1 0.
            // - Finally, the current position moves forward by 8: 3 4 2 1[0]. The skip size increases to 4.

            //you can multiply them together to produce 12.

            //First, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes 
            //instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will 
            //allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never 
            //larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for 
            //each character: 49,44,50,44,51.
            //Once you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the 
            //sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths 
            //should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard 
            //length suffix values).
            //Second, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same 
            //length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For 
            //example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same 
            //length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include 
            //the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).
            //
            //Once the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the 
            //sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do 
            //this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there 
            //are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen 
            //elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements 
            //of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.
            //For example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, 
            //you would calculate the first output number like this:
            // 65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64
            //Perform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the 
            //sixteen numbers in your dense hash.
            //Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the 
            //dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), 
            //always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first 
            //three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six 
            //characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal 
            //representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0 - f) long.
            //Here are some example hashes:
            // - The empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.
            // - AoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.
            // - 1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.
            // - 1,2,4 becomes 63960835bcdc130f0b66d7ff4f6a5a8e.
